The `geese' package

Geese is a set of utilities for manipulating coordinates and
coordinate systems on bitmapped maps.

It's both a library for use from Python programs (the 'skatan'
stuff depends on parts of it) and utilities you can run, namely
'geese_pick', 'geese_plot', and so on.

Some of these have been (re)written in C++, but the Python library
still exists.

Basically, geese is based on the following observations:

- Finding coordinates from maps by hand is difficult, boring and error-prone.
- It's hard to look at a coordinate and tell where it is in the terrain.
- Plotting coordinates on maps by hand is boring and error-prone.
- Keeping high-quality digital copies of maps for personal use is (in
  the days of flatbed scanners) convenient and legal (or at least ethical).
- Two persons need not share the same maps to share geographic data;
  all they need are reasonable-quality maps covering the same area,
  and some metadata telling them how these map to the terrain.
- If a map's projection is simple enough, you only have to measure the
  pixel--coordinate mapping for two points on the map to have a good
  mapping.

Geese is mostly limited to handle coordinates in the "Rikets Nät"
(RT-90, "Swedish Grid"). See geese.segrid for details.  It's probably
trivial to generalize it to other national systems working along the
same principles, but I don't want to mess with broad generalizations
for which I have no test data or documentation ...


INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS

Use the Makefile ('make install') for installation. This will
install the command-line tool(s), documentation and (indirectly,
through Python's 'distutils') the 'geese' Python package.

Python 2.3 or higher is required for installation and use. (Although I
cannot verify that any more, since I use Python 2.5 and 2.6 these
days.)

Some parts also need PIL, aka the Python Imaging Library (the Image
and ImageDraw modules).  Others need John Bradley's 'xv' image viewer.
