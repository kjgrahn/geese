The `geese' package

Geese is a set of utilities for manipulating coordinates and
coordinate systems on bitmapped maps.

At one point it was a set of Python modules too, but these have been
obsoleted; they were never ported to Python 3. Now it's all written
in C++.

Basically, geese is based on the following observations:

- Finding coordinates from maps by hand is difficult, boring and error-prone.
- It's hard to look at a coordinate and tell where it is in the terrain.
- Plotting coordinates on maps by hand is boring and error-prone.
- Keeping high-quality digital copies of maps for personal use is (in
  the days of flatbed scanners) convenient and legal (or at least ethical).
- Two persons need not share the same maps to share geographic data;
  all they need are reasonable-quality maps covering the same area,
  and some metadata telling them how these map to the terrain.
- If a map's projection is simple enough, you only have to measure the
  pixel--coordinate mapping for two points on the map to have a good
  mapping.

Geese is mostly limited to handle coordinates in the "Rikets Nät"
(RT-90, "Swedish Grid"). It's probably trivial to generalize it to
other national systems working along the same principles, but I don't
want to mess with broad generalizations for which I have no test data
or documentation ...


INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS

Use the Makefile ('make && make install') for installation. This will
install the command-line tools and documentation.

You need:
- a Unix system
- a C++11 compiler
- anydim <git://snipabacken.se/anydim>
- orchis <git://snipabacken.se/orchis> if you want to run the unit tests
- libgd  <https://libgd.github.io>
- John Bradley's 'xv' image viewer.
