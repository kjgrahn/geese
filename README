the `geese' Python package

Geese is a set of utilities for manipulating coordinates and
coordinate systems on bitmapped maps.

Right now it's not really an end user thing, but I have to release it
since other software (skatan) depends on the geese.find algorithm.

In the longer run, Geese is based on the following observations:

- Finding coordinates from maps by hand is difficult, boring and
  error-prone.
- It's hard to look at a coordinate and tell where it is in the
  terrain.
- Plotting coordinates on maps by hand is boring and error-prone.
- Keeping high-quality digital copies of maps for personal use is (in
  the days of flatbed scanners) convenient and legal.
- Two persons need not share the same maps to share geographic data;
  all they need are reasonable-quality maps covering the same area,
  and some metadata telling them how these map to the terrain.
- If a map's projection is simple enough, you only have to measure the
  pixel--coordinate mapping for two points on the map to have a good
  mapping.

Geese is mostly limited to handle coordinates in the "Rikets Nät"
("Swedish Grid"). See geese.segrid for details.  It's probably trivial
to generalize it to other national systems working along the same
principles, but I don't want to mess with broad generalizations for
which I have no test data or documentation ...

The original ISO C++ source for the core parts of geese is still in
the distribution, but it's unused and might suffer from bit rot now or
in the future.
