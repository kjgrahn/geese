Major changes (with focus on user-visible changes) to 'geese', per version.

_________________________________________

geese 1.1 (2004-09-11):

  - Introduced the geese_pick utility for pulling coordinates from maps.
    This also introduces the file format for describing maps.

  - Now installs via the Makefile. Python's distutils apparently can't
    do all that's needed.

geese 1.0 (2004-08-09):
  - First real release. An ugly geese.find bug which caused skatan to
    sometimes report incorrect coordinates for places was recently
    fixed.
