Major changes (with focus on user-visible changes) to 'geese', per version.

_________________________________________

geese 2.4 (2010-09-18):

  - New utility 'geese_world' for listing georeferencing information.

  - Geese 2.0 disabled the MD5 checksum checking. Enabling it again;
    you cannot now run geese_ref(1) if the mapping file lists a
    checksum, and that checksum doesn't match the file.

geese 2.2 (2010-09-16):

  - New utility 'geese_ref' for georeferencing maps.

geese 2.1 (2010-09-14):

  - geese_pick: use "world files" if such things exist and the normal
    big coordinate file doesn't.

geese 2.0 (2010-09-12):

  - Parts rewritten in C++, in preparation for extending the functionality.
    I got tired of Python's lack of static typing.

geese 1.11 (2010-07-16):

  - geese_plot: new command for controlling the size and color of the
    markers on the map.

geese 1.9 (2007-05-19):

  - geese_pick: also print the distance between selected coordinates,
    in case someone wants to use it to measure distances.

geese 1.8 (2007-05-19):

  - Used to emit warnings about os.tempnam being insecure, when run
    under Python 2.3 or later. Fixed. Unfortunately, this means it no
    longer runs under earlier Python versions -- I could find no way
    to create temporary files which both worked in 2.1 and didn't make
    2.3 whine.

  - Slightly better command-line (an 'exit' command and so on).

geese 1.7 (2006-02-07):

  - geese_plot: bug fix. Map images in grayscale format
    (e.g. grayscale JPEG) would cause crashes. Some other formats
    (like monochrome or palette-based images) may still have problems,
    though -- it's not easy to paint into a a general image using the
    PIL.

geese 1.6 (2005-01-09):

  - geese_plot didn't work at all in 1.5 - fixed.
  - Made geese_plot significantly faster by (by default) saving the
    temporary image as JPEG rather than PNG.

geese 1.5 (2005-01-08):

  - geese_plot: better markers on the map. The big, dull red circles
    are now smaller white circles with a black border. This is still a
    compromise between visibility of the points and visibility of the
    map near the point though ...

geese 1.4 (2005-01-04):

  - geese_pick and geese_plot can now print their (geese's, actually)
    version numbers.

  - geese_pick: coordinates are printed in several ways,
    for convenience.

geese 1.3 (2004-10-03):

  - New utility geese_plot for (still a rough draft)

geese 1.2 (2004-09-12):

  - geese_pick no longer keeps xv running after it has exited itself.
  - geese_pick calculates and prints the scale and area of the map it
    displays.
  - New geese.library.Map methods.

geese 1.1 (2004-09-11):

  - Introduced the geese_pick utility for pulling coordinates from maps.
    This also introduces the file format for describing maps.
  - Now installs via the Makefile. Python's distutils apparently can't
    do all that's needed.

geese 1.0 (2004-08-09):
  - First real release. An ugly geese.find bug which caused skatan to
    sometimes report incorrect coordinates for places was recently
    fixed.
