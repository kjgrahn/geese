Major changes (with focus on user-visible changes) to 'geese', per version.

_________________________________________

geese 1.6 (2005-01-09):

  - geese_plot didn't work at all in 1.5 - fixed.
  - Made geese_plot significantly faster by (by default) saving the
    temporary image as JPEG rather than PNG.

geese 1.5 (2005-01-08):

  - geese_plot: better markers on the map. The big, dull red circles
    are now smaller white circles with a black border. This is still a
    compromise between visibility of the points and visibility of the
    map near the point though ...

geese 1.4 (2005-01-04):

  - geese_pick and geese_plot can now print their (geese's, actually)
    version numbers.

  - geese_pick: coordinates are printed in several ways,
    for convenience.

geese 1.3 (2004-10-03):

  - New utility geese_plot for (still a rough draft)

geese 1.2 (2004-09-12):

  - geese_pick no longer keeps xv running after it has exited itself.
  - geese_pick calculates and prints the scale and area of the map it
    displays.
  - New geese.library.Map methods.

geese 1.1 (2004-09-11):

  - Introduced the geese_pick utility for pulling coordinates from maps.
    This also introduces the file format for describing maps.
  - Now installs via the Makefile. Python's distutils apparently can't
    do all that's needed.

geese 1.0 (2004-08-09):
  - First real release. An ugly geese.find bug which caused skatan to
    sometimes report incorrect coordinates for places was recently
    fixed.
