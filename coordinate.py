"""Translation between two coordinate systems, where
one is a (uniformly) scaled, rotated and transposed
version of the other.

Intended to provide a mapping between coordinates in the swedish
Rikets Nät projection (which appears as a square grid with origo to
the south-west of Sweden) on many national high-resolution maps, and
pixel coordinates in bitmap images generated by scanning a part of
such a map. Obviously, such scanned images are scaled and translated
relative to the Rikets Nät, and if the scan isn't perfect they tend to
be slightly rotated as well.

Bitmap images are, for the purposes of this module, assumed to have a
lower-left corner as origo.

As it turns out, only two points in the source and destination
coordinate systems are needed to determine the translation.
