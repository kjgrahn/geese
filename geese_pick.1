geese_pick \- pick coordinates from digital maps

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B geese_pick
is a small interactive utility for picking coordinates from
digital maps, given
.IR map-file ,
the actual image file containing the map,
and
.IR mapping-file ,
which describes how one or more images map onto the real world.
.P
Doing this with a real paper map is difficult, boring and
error-prone, even if it has a superimposed grid.
On the other hand, it is relatively simple and safe to
scan, borrow or buy maps and finding their coordinate systems.
.
.SH "MAPPING FILE FORMAT"
This file contains a series of entries describing different maps.
It is line-oriented, with entries separated by empty lines.
Lines starting with
.B #
are comment lines, and are ignored.
.P
These kinds of lines actually describe a map:
.
.IP \- 2m
File names, with paths stripped.
A map may be known under many names (perhaps stored in color and grayscale,
PNG and JPEG format) so this may be given several times.
.
.IP \-
MD5 checksums, as generated by e.g.
.BR md5sum (1).
If a map entry has checksums, one of them must match the file provided to
.BR geese_pick .
The purpose of this is to minimize the risk of picking the wrong combination
of image and map entry, and getting insane coordinates.
.
.IP \-
Image dimensions, on the form
.IB width x height\fR.
.
.IP \-
Two mappings from world to pixel coordinates, on the form
\fInorth east \fB-> \fIx\fB, \fIy\fR.
These are enough to describe the mapping
even if the image is rotated versus the coordinate system\(em\
as if we had taken a flat Earth, put it rather sloppily
in God's Great Xerox Machine, and pressed the button.
